  abstract = {Continuous multimodal representations suitable for multimodal information retrieval are usually obtained with methods that heavily rely on multimodal autoencoders. In video hyperlinking, a task that aims at retrieving video segments, the state of the art is a variation of two interlocked networks working in opposing directions. These systems provide good multimodal embeddings and are also capable of translating from one representation space to the other. Operating on representation spaces, these networks lack the ability to operate in the original spaces (text or image), which makes it difficult to visualize the crossmodal function, and do not generalize well to unseen data. Recently, generative adversarial networks have gained popularity and have been used for generating realistic synthetic data and for obtaining high-level, single-modal latent representation spaces. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of using GANs to obtain multimodal representations. We show that GANs can be used for multimodal representation learning and that they provide multimodal representations that are superior to representations obtained with multimodal autoencoders. Additionally, we illustrate the ability of visualizing crossmodal translations that can provide human-interpretable insights on learned GAN-based video hyperlinking models.},

The metrics laid out in the initial paper show that utility can still be achieved in synthetic data while maintaining both privacy of the model and the data being generated. Specifically, we focused on the success of the Wasserstein GAN method, renamed HealthGAN, in comparison to other data generating methods.In this paper, we provide additional novel metrics to quantify the susceptibility of these generative models to membership inference attacks [14]. We also introduce Discriminator Testing, a new method of determining whether the different generators overfit on the training data, potentially resulting in privacy losses.These privacy issues are of high importance as we prepare a final workflow for generating synthetic data based on real data in a secure environment. The results of these tests complement the initial tests as they show that the Parzen windows method, while having a low privacy loss in adversarial accuracy metrics, fails to preserve privacy in the membership inference attack. Only HealthGAN shows both an optimal value for privacy loss and the membership inference attack. The discriminator testing adds to the confidence as HealthGAN retains resemblance to the training data, without reproducing the training data.},

Rebalancing skewed datasets using synthetic data created by generative adversarial networks (GANs) has shown potential to mitigate disparate impact on minoritized subgroups. However, such generative models are subject to privacy attacks that can expose sensitive data from the training dataset. Differential privacy (DP) is the current leading solution for privacy-preserving machine learning. Differentially private GANs (DP GANs) are often considered a potential solution for improving model fairness while maintaining privacy of sensitive training data. We investigate the impact of using synthetic images from DP GANs on downstream classification model utility and fairness. We demonstrate that existing DP GANs cannot simultaneously maintain model utility, privacy, and fairness. The images generated from GAN models trained with DP exhibit extreme decreases in image quality and utility which leads to poor downstream classification model performance. Our evaluation highlights the friction between privacy, fairness, and utility and how this directly translates into real loss of performance and representation in common machine learning settings. Our results show that additional work improving the utility and fairness of DP generative models is required before they can be utilized as a potential solution to privacy and fairness issues stemming from lack of diversity in the training dataset.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning has increased our ability to model large quantities of data efficiently in a short time. Machine learning approaches in many application domains require collecting large volumes of data from distributed sources and combining them. However, sharing of data from multiple sources leads to concerns about privacy. Privacy regulations like European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have specific requirements on when and how such data can be shared. Even when there are no specific regulations, organizations may have concerns about revealing their data. For example in cybersecurity, organizations are reluctant to share their network-related data to permit machine learning-based intrusion detectors to be built. This has, in particular, hampered academic research. We need an approach to make confidential data widely available for accurate data analysis without violating the privacy of the data subjects. Privacy in shared data has been discussed in prior work focusing on anonymization and encryption of data. An alternate approach to make data available for analysis without sharing sensitive information is by replacing sensitive information with synthetic data that behave as original data for all analytical purposes. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the well-known models to generate synthetic samples that can have the same distributional characteristics as the original data. However, modeling tabular data using GAN is a non-trivial task. Tabular data contain a mix of categorical and continuous variables and require specialized constraints as described in the CTGAN model. In this paper, we propose a framework to generate privacy-preserving synthetic data suitable for release for analytical purposes. The data is generated using the CTGAN approach, and so is analytically similar to the original dataset. To ensure that the generated data meet the privacy requirements, we use the principle of t-closeness. We ensure that the distribution of attributes in the released dataset is within a certain threshold distance from the real dataset. We also encrypt sensitive values in the final released version of the dataset to minimize information leakage. We show that in a variety of cases, models trained on this synthetic data instead of the real data perform nearly as well when tested on the real data. Specifically, we show that the machine learning models used for network event/attack recognition tasks do not have a significant loss in accuracy when trained on data generated from our framework in place of the real dataset.},

A statistical analysis of the synthetically generated cyber data determines the goodness of fit, aiming to improve cyber threat detection.

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is one of the standard methods in the field of multimedia research to perform data classification, detection, segmentation and generation. Within DL, generative adversarial networks (GANs) represents a new and highly popular branch of methods. GANs have the capability to generate, from random noise or conditional input, new data realizations within the dataset population. While generation is popular and highly useful in itself, GANs can also be useful to improve supervised DL. GAN-based approaches can, for example, perform segmentation or create synthetic data for training other DL models. The latter one is especially interesting in domains where not much training data exists such as medical multimedia. In this respect, performing a series of experiments involving GANs can be very time consuming due to the lack of tools that support the whole pipeline such as structured training, testing and tracking of different architectures and configurations. Moreover, the success of generative models is highly dependent on hyper-parameter optimization and statistical analysis in the design and fine-tuning stages. In this paper, we present a new tool called GANEx for making the whole pipeline of training, inference and benchmarking GANs faster, more efficient and more structured. The tool consists of a special library called FastGAN which allows designing generative models very fast. Moreover, GANEx has a graphical user interface to support structured experimenting, quick hyper-parameter configurations and output analysis. The presented tool is not limited to a specific DL framework and can be therefore even used to compare the performance of cross frameworks.},

Although GAN achieves the desirable performance, the challenge is that the mode collapse easily happens in the joint optimization of generator and discriminator. This study copes with this challenge by improving the model regularization by means of representing the weight uncertainty in GAN. A new Bayesian GAN is formulated and implemented to learn a regularized model from diverse data where the strong modes are flattened via the marginalization and the issues of model collapse and gradient vanishing are alleviated. In particular, we present a variational GAN (VGAN) where the encoder, generator and discriminator are jointly estimated according to the variational Bayesian inference. The experiments on image generation over two tasks (MNIST and CeleA) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed VGAN to the variational autoencoder, the standard GAN and the Bayesian GAN based on the sampling method. The learning efficiency and generation performance are evaluated.},

We propose a novel framework for generating synthetic data that closely approximates the joint distribution of variables in an original EHR dataset, providing a readily accessible, legally and ethically appropriate solution to support more open data sharing, enabling the development of AI solutions. In order to address issues around lack of clarity in defining sufficient anonymization, we created a quantifiable, mathematical definition for ``identifiability''. We used a conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN) framework to generate synthetic data while minimize patient identifiability that is defined based on the probability of re-identification given the combination of all data on any individual patient. We compared models fitted to our synthetically generated data to those fitted to the real data across four independent datasets to evaluate similarity in model performance, while assessing the extent to which original observations can be identified from the synthetic data. Our model, ADS-GAN, consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrated reliability in the joint distributions. We propose that this method could be used to develop datasets that can be made publicly available while considerably lowering the risk of breaching patient confidentiality.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to present different techniques and factors that affect the measurement accuracy of a commercial laser tracker responsible for capturing checkpoints used in machine tool volumetric verification. This study was conducted to uncover various sources of error affecting the measurement uncertainty of the laser tracker, additional sources of error that further contributed to the uncertainty, and the factors influencing these techniques. We also define several noise reduction techniques for the measurements. The improvement in the accuracy of captured points focuses on a multilateration technique and its various resolution methods both analytically and geometrically. Similarly, we present trilateration and least squares techniques that can be used for laser tracker self-calibration, which is an essential parameter in multilateration. This paper presents the influence of the spatial distribution of laser trackers (LTs) in measurement noise reduction by multilateration, which produces an improvement in volumetric error machine tool reduction. A study of the spatial angle between LTs, the distance and the visibility of the point to be measured are presented using a synthetic test. All of these factors limit the scope of multilateration. Similarly, a comparison of self-calibration techniques using the least squares and trilateration methods with which to determine the relative position of the laser tracker employees is presented. We also present the influence of the relationship between the radial and angular measurement noise self-calibration processes as it relates to the volumetric error reduction achieved by the machine tool with multilateration. All studies were performed using synthetic tests generated using a synthetic data parametric generator.},

  abstract = {Devising domain- and model-agnostic evaluation metrics for generative models is an important and as yet unresolved problem. Most existing metrics, which were tailored solely to the image synthesis setup, exhibit a limited capacity for diagnosing the different modes of failure of generative models across broader application domains. In this paper, we introduce a 3-dimensional evaluation metric, ({$\alpha$}-Precision, {$\beta$}-Recall, Authenticity), that characterizes the fidelity, diversity and generalization performance of any generative model in a domainagnostic fashion. Our metric unifies statistical divergence measures with precision-recall analysis, enabling sample- and distribution-level diagnoses of model fidelity and diversity. We introduce generalization as an additional, independent dimension (to the fidelity-diversity trade-off) that quantifies the extent to which a model copies training data\textemdash a crucial performance indicator when modeling sensitive data with requirements on privacy. The three metric components correspond to (interpretable) probabilistic quantities, and are estimated via sample-level binary classification. The sample-level nature of our metric inspires a novel use case which we call model auditing, wherein we judge the quality of individual samples generated by a (black-box) model, discarding lowquality samples and hence improving the overall model performance in a post-hoc manner.},

  abstract = {Two elements have been essential to AI's recent boom: (1) deep neural nets and the theory and practice behind them; and (2) cloud computing with its abundant labeled data and large computing resources. Abundant labeled data is available for key domains such as images, speech, natural language processing, and recommendation engines. However, there are many other domains where such data is not available, or access to it is highly restricted for privacy reasons, as with health and financial data. Even when abundant data is available, it is often not labeled. Doing such labeling is labor-intensive and non-scalable. As a result, to the best of our knowledge, key domains still lack labeled data or have at most toy data; or the synthetic data must have access to real data from which it can mimic new data. This paper outlines work to generate realistic synthetic data for an important domain: credit card transactions. Some challenges: there are many patterns and correlations in real purchases. There are millions of merchants and innumerable locations. Those merchants offer a wide variety of goods. Who shops where and when? How much do people pay? What is a realistic fraudulent transaction? We use a mixture of technical approaches and domain knowledge including mechanics of credit card processing, a broad set of consumer domains: electronics, clothing, hair styling, etc. Connecting everything is a virtual world. This paper outlines some of our key techniques and provides evidence that the data generated is indeed realistic. Beyond the scope of this paper: (1) use of our data to develop and train models to predict fraud; (2) coupling models and the synthetic dataset to assess performance in designing accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs.},

Water saturation is the solution of the Archie equation, but in many situations, a quick and convenient solution of this equation may be a hard problem, mainly when there is no confidence on porosity and when the conventional core analysis does not supply the cementation exponent and the water resistivity. In these cases, an association of the Hingle plot with the Pickett plot may be used to solve the Archie equation, but as any graphic these methods are frequently subject to visual misinterpretation. In this work, we assume the resistivity\textendash porosity dependence in the Archie equation as an angular pattern and introduce an intelligent algorithm based on a new model of artificial neural network, named as angular competitive neural network, which was designed to discover angular patterns present in the data. This characteristic makes the angular competitive neural network be able to produce all parameters needed to solve the Archie equation, performing angular pattern recognition in the Hingle plot and in the Pickett plot. This method is presented with synthetic data and evaluated using actual wireline logs and conventional core analysis.},

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role as a defense mechanism in networks against adversarial attackers. Machine Learning methods provide various cybersecurity tools. However, these methods require plenty of data to be trained efficiently, which may be hard to collect or to use due to privacy reasons. One of the most notable Machine Learning tools is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and it has great potential for tabular data synthesis. In this work, we start by briefly presenting the most popular GAN architectures, VanillaGAN, WGAN, and WGAN-GP. Focusing on tabular data generation, CTGAN, CopulaGAN, and TableGAN models are used for the creation of synthetic IDS data. Specifically, the models are trained and evaluated on an NSL-KDD dataset, considering the limitations and requirements that this procedure needs. Finally, based on certain quantitative and qualitative methods, we argue and evaluate the most prominent GANs for tabular network data synthesis.},

  abstract = {Science is a cumulative endeavour as new knowledge is often created in the process of interpreting and combining existing knowledge. This is why literature reviews have long played a decisive role in scholarship. The quality of literature reviews is particularly determined by the literature search process. As Sir Isaac Newton eminently put it: ``If I can see further, it is because I am standing on the shoulders of giants.'' Drawing on this metaphor, the goal of writing a literature review is to reconstruct the giant of accumulated knowledge in a specific domain. And in doing so, a literature search represents the fundamental first step that makes up the giant's skeleton and largely determines its reconstruction in the subsequent literature analysis. In this paper, we argue that the process of searching the literature must be comprehensibly described. Only then can readers assess the exhaustiveness of the review and other scholars in the field can more confidently (re)use the results in their own research. We set out to explore the methodological rigour of literature review articles published in ten major information systems (IS) journals and show that many of these reviews do not thoroughly document the process of literature search. The results drawn from our analysis lead us to call for more rigour in documenting the literature search process and to present guidelines for crafting a literature review and search in the IS domain.},

Controlled tabular adjustment (CTA) is one of the available methods for this purpose. CTA formulates an optimization problem that looks for the safe table which is closest to the original one. The standard CTA approach results in a mixed integer linear optimization (MILO) problem, which is very challenging for current technology. In this work we present a much less costly variant of CTA that formulates a multiobjective linear optimization (LO) problem, where binary variables are pre-fixed, and the resulting continuous problem is solved by lexicographic optimization. Extensive computational results are reported using both commercial (CPLEX and XPRESS) and open source (Clp) solvers, with either simplex or interior-point methods, on a set of real instances. Most instances were successfully solved with the LO-CTA variant in less than one hour, while many of them are computationally very expensive with the MILO-CTA formulation. The interior-point method outperformed simplex in this particular application. \textcopyright{} 2017, \textcopyright{} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.}

  abstract = {Detecting money laundering in gambling is becoming increasingly challenging for the gambling industry as consumers migrate to online channels. Whilst increasingly stringent regulations have been applied over the years to prevent money laundering in gambling, despite this, online gambling is still a channel for criminals to spend proceeds from crime. Complementing online gambling's growth more concerns are raised to its effects compared with gambling in traditional, physical formats, as it might introduce higher levels of problem gambling or fraudulent behaviour due to its nature of immediate interaction with online gambling experience. However, in most cases the main issue when organisations try to tackle those areas is the absence of high quality data. Since fraud detection related issues face the significant problem of the class imbalance, in this paper we propose a novel system based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic data in order to train a supervised classifier. Our framework Synthetic Data Generation GAN (SDG-GAN), manages to outperformed density based over-sampling methods and improve the classification performance of benchmarks datasets and the real world gambling fraud dataset.},

Throughout history, there have been continuous advances in sensor development, data acquisition systems, and signal processing techniques. Despite these advancements, FPCG based point of care technologies are facing serious challenges in translating from basic research to clinical trials and commercialization. This is partly due to the noisy characteristic associated with FPCG, to the lesser clinical knowledge about fetal and maternal physiological profiles, to the unavailability of gold standard databases, and to the limited application of reliable signal processing techniques. In order to understand why FPCG continues to be underutilized, it is necessary to know about the existing standards of fetal monitoring, data collection trends, and the signal processing aspects. To serve this purpose, this paper will first provide an overview of the existing standards of fetal monitoring and then provide a comprehensive survey on Fetal Phonocardiography with focus on trends in data collection, signal processing techniques and synthesis models that have been developed to date. Finally, a set of guidelines will be proposed for future research and use in signal analysis, processing and modeling based on the outlined challenges.},

  abstract = {Synthetic tabular data generation becomes crucial when real data is limited, expensive to collect, or simply cannot be used due to privacy concerns. However, producing good quality synthetic data is challenging. Several probabilistic, statistical, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) based approaches have been presented for synthetic tabular data generation. Once generated, evaluating the quality of the synthetic data is quite challenging. Some of the traditional metrics have been used in the literature but there is lack of a common, robust, and single metric. This makes it difficult to properly compare the effectiveness of different synthetic tabular data generation methods. In this paper we propose a new universal metric, TabSynDex, for robust evaluation of synthetic data. TabSynDex assesses the similarity of synthetic data with real data through different component scores which evaluate the characteristics that are desirable for "high quality" synthetic data. Being a single score metric, TabSynDex can also be used to observe and evaluate the training of neural network based approaches. This would help in obtaining insights that was not possible earlier. Further, we present several baseline models for comparative analysis of the proposed evaluation metric with existing generative models.},

We use this method to generate synthetic time series data that is composed of nested sequences using hidden Markov models and regression models which are initially trained on real datasets. We test our synthetic data generation technique on a real annotated smart home dataset. We use time series distance measures as a baseline to determine how realistic the generated data is compared to real data and demonstrate that SynSys produces more realistic data in terms of distance compared to random data generation, data from another home, and data from another time period. Finally, we apply our synthetic data generation technique to the problem of generating data when only a small amount of ground truth data is available. Using semi-supervised learning we demonstrate that SynSys is able to improve activity recognition accuracy compared to using the small amount of real data alone.},

  abstract = {Real-world binary classification tasks are in many cases imbalanced, where the minority class is much smaller than the majority class. This skewness is challenging for machine learning algorithms as they tend to focus on the majority and greatly misclassify the minority. Adding synthetic minority samples to the dataset before training the model is a popular technique to address this difficulty and is commonly achieved by interpolating minority samples. Tabular datasets are often multi-modal and contain discrete (categorical) features in addition to continuous ones which makes interpolation of samples non-trivial. To address this, we propose a latent space interpolation framework which (1) maps the multi-modal samples to a dense continuous latent space using an autoencoder; (2) applies oversampling by interpolation in the latent space; and (3) maps the synthetic samples back to the original feature space. We defined metrics to directly evaluate the quality of the minority data generated and showed that our framework generates better synthetic data than the existing methods. Furthermore, the superior synthetic data yields better prediction quality in downstream binary classification tasks, as was demonstrated in extensive experiments with 27 publicly available real-world datasets},

Common methods of de-identification implemented to enable the sharing of data are sometimes inadequate to protect the individuals contained in the data. For our research, we investigate the ability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce realistic medical time series data which can be used without concerns over privacy. The aim is to generate synthetic ECG signals representative of normal ECG waveforms. GANs have been used successfully to generate good quality synthetic time series and have been shown to prevent re-identification of individual records. In this work, a range of GAN architectures are developed to generate synthetic sine waves and synthetic ECG. Two evaluation metrics are then used to quantitatively assess how suitable the synthetic data is for real world applications such as clinical training and data analysis. Finally, we discuss the privacy concerns associated with sharing synthetic data produced by GANs and test their ability to withstand a simple membership inference attack. For the first time we both quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that GAN architecture can successfully generate time series signals that are not only structurally similar to the training sets but also diverse in nature across generated samples. We also report on their ability to withstand a simple membership inference attack, protecting the privacy of the training set.},

We determined the focal mechanism of the main event using teleseismic P wave arrivals and regional waveform inversion for the moment tensor. We relocated the best set of aftershocks (30 events) with magnitudes larger than 2.0 recorded from May to June 2008 by a temporary local network as well as by stations of the Colombia national network. We successfully estimated coseismic deformation using SAR interferometry, despite distortion in some areas of the interferogram by atmospheric noise. The deformation was compared to synthetic data for rectangular dislocations in an elastic half-space. Nine source parameters (strike, dip, length, width, strike-slip deformation, dip-slip deformation, latitude shift, longitude shift, and minimum depth) were inverted to fit the observed changes in line-of-sight (LOS) toward the satellite four derived parameters were also estimated (rake, average slip, maximum depth and seismic moment). The aftershock relocation, the focal mechanism and the coseismic dislocation model agree with a right-lateral strike-slip fault with nodal planes oriented NE-SW and NW-SE. We use the results of the waveform inversion, radar interferometry and aftershock relocations to identify the high-angle NE-SW nodal plane as the primary fault. The inferred subsurface rupture length is roughly 11~km, which is consistent with the 12~km long distribution of aftershocks. This coseismic model can provide insights on earthquake mechanisms and seismic hazard assessments for the area, including the 8 million residents of Colombia's nearby capital city Bogota. The 2008 Quetame earthquake appears to be associated with the northeastward ``escape'' of the North Andean block, and it may help to illuminate how margin-parallel shear slip is partitioned in the Eastern Cordillera.},

Compressed sensing realized by means of regularized deconvolution and the finite isotropic wavelet transform is effective and reliable in hard X-ray solar imaging.                                         Methods               . The method uses the finite isotropic wavelet transform with the Meyer function as the mother wavelet. Furthermore, compressed sensing is realized by optimizing a sparsity-promoting regularized objective function by means of the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm. Eventually, the regularization parameter is selected by means of the Miller criterion.                                         Results               . The method is applied against both synthetic data mimicking measurements made with the Spectrometer/Telescope Imaging X-rays (STIX) and experimental observations provided by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). The performances of the method are qualitatively validated by comparing some morphological properties of the reconstructed sources with those of the corresponding synthetic configurations. Furthermore, the results concerning experimental data are compared with those obtained by applying other visibility-based reconstruction methods.                                         Conclusions               . The results show that when the new method is applied to synthetic STIX visibility sets, it provides reconstructions with a spatial accuracy comparable to the accuracy provided by the most popular method in hard X-ray solar imaging and with a higher spatial resolution. Furthermore, when it is applied to experimental RHESSI data, the reconstructions are characterized by reliable photometry and by a notable reduction of the ringing effects caused by the instrument point spread function.},

In this work, we propose a Recurrent GAN (RGAN) and Recurrent Conditional GAN (RCGAN) to produce realistic real-valued multi-dimensional time series, with an emphasis on their application to medical data. RGANs make use of recurrent neural networks in the generator and the discriminator. In the case of RCGANs, both of these RNNs are conditioned on auxiliary information. We demonstrate our models in a set of toy datasets, where we show visually and quantitatively (using sample likelihood and maximum mean discrepancy) that they can successfully generate realistic time-series. We also describe novel evaluation methods for GANs, where we generate a synthetic labelled training dataset, and evaluate on a real test set the performance of a model trained on the synthetic data, and vice-versa. We illustrate with these metrics that RCGANs can generate time-series data useful for supervised training, with only minor degradation in performance on real test data. This is demonstrated on digit classification from 'serialised' MNIST and by training an early warning system on a medical dataset of 17,000 patients from an intensive care unit. We further discuss and analyse the privacy concerns that may arise when using RCGANs to generate realistic synthetic medical time series data.},

Traditional solutions to this demand have limitations on effectively balancing the tradeoff between privacy and utility of the released data. Thus, the database community and machine learning community have recently studied a new problem of relational data synthesis using generative adversarial networks (GAN) and proposed various algorithms. However, these algorithms are not compared under the same framework and thus it is hard for practitioners to understand GAN's benefits and limitations. To bridge the gaps, we conduct so far the most comprehensive experimental study that investigates applying GAN to relational data synthesis. We introduce a unified GAN-based framework and define a space of design solutions for each component in the framework, including neural network architectures and training strategies. We conduct extensive experiments to explore the design space and compare with traditional data synthesis approaches. Through extensive experiments, we find that GAN is very promising for relational data synthesis, and provide guidance for selecting appropriate design solutions. We also point out limitations of GAN and identify future research directions.},

Data-driven fault diagnosis methods have gained increasing popularity considering the wide availabilities of operational data and advances in data analytics. In practice, the data-driven fault diagnosis performance can be severely degraded by the imbalanced nature of building operational data, i.e., the data samples of faulty operations are much smaller than that of normal operations. This study serves as a comprehensive study to investigate the potential of different data synthesis techniques in enhancing the performance of imbalanced AHU fault diagnosis. A variety of data synthesis strategies, ranging from conventional random sampling-based to advanced variational autoencoder-based techniques, have been developed for synthetic data generation. Data experiments have been designed to quantitatively evaluate the value of data synthesis in data scenarios considering various data amounts and imbalanced ratios. The research results indicate that synthetic data can significantly enhance the performance of imbalanced AHU fault diagnosis by up to 8.94\%. Optimal data synthesis strategies have been identified in different data scenarios. The research outcomes are helpful for the development of reliable data-driven tools for practical tasks in building energy management.},

  author = {Fang, Kevin and Mugunthan, Vaikkunth and Ramkumar, Vayd},
  abstract = {There are several shortcomings in current methods of generating synthetic data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). First, they tend to only emulate certain attributes of the original dataset. Second, they do not effectively model unbalanced discrete columns, long tails, or bimodal distributions of continuous columns. Lastly, these approaches often do not consider the potential for information leakage from the generated data. We propose UniformGAN, a GAN with a novel uniform loss function, which addresses these challenges and provides strong privacy guarantees using differential privacy. UniformGAN preprocesses datasets to transpose each column into a uniform distribution. We use a modified D eep C onvolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) architecture in which we replace ReLU activation functions with the more robust SeLU, which has significantly b etter p erformance a nd b etter c onvergence properties, and apply Dense-Sparse-Dense training to our network. We also use differential privacy to add noise to the discriminator during training. Along with UniformGAN, we provide a configurable command-line tool to generate and evaluate synthetic datasets on numerous metrics. It allows users to generate synthetic datasets from CTGAN, TableGAN, UniformGAN, or a custom framework and analyze the resultant datasets. This tool will help data scientists and industry users compare different synthetic dataset generation models and enable them to improve existing methods. We evaluated UniformGAN using multiple datasets, including the Adult, Covertype, and Credit Kaggle datasets, as well as two insurance-related Kaggle datasets. The results show that, when used on datatsets containing a large number of continuous columns, UniformGAN out performs other methods by producing synthetic data with similar correlations and distributions as the original dataset while ensuring privacy.},

Evapotranspiration (ET), assumed to be high for most willow species used in environmental projects, affects hydrological cycles and is of key interest for project managers working with willows. Here, we present a comprehensive review of ET rates provided in the literature for the genus Salix. We aim to summarize current knowledge of willow ET and analyze its variability depending on context. We compiled and analyzed data from 57 studies, covering 16 countries, 19 willow species and dozens of cultivars. We found a mean reported ET rate of 4.6\,{$\pm$}\,4.2\,mm/d, with minimum and maximum values of 0.7 and 22.7\,mm/d respectively. Although results reported here varied significantly between some species, overall interspecific standard deviation ({$\pm$}3.6\,mm/d) was similar to intraspecific variation ({$\pm$}3.3\,mm/d) calculated for S. viminalis, suggesting a greater influence of the growing context on ET than species identity. In terms of environmental and management variables, water supply, fertilization and contamination were identified as driving factors of ET across willow species. Effects of root age, experimental context, planting density and soil type were more nuanced. Our findings provide synthetic data regarding willow ET. We encourage practitioners who use ET data from the literature to be aware of the main drivers of ET and to consider the influence of the experimental aspects of a study in order to interpret data accurately and improve project planning.},

In this paper we develop a loss function for multi-label learning, based on the Wasserstein distance. The Wasserstein distance provides a natural notion of dissimilarity for probability measures. Although optimizing with respect to the exact Wasserstein distance is costly, recent work has described a regularized approximation that is efficiently computed. We describe an efficient learning algorithm based on this regularization, as well as a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance from probability measures to unnormalized measures. We also describe a statistical learning bound for the loss. The Wasserstein loss can encourage smoothness of the predictions with respect to a chosen metric on the output space. We demonstrate this property on a real-data tag prediction problem, using the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons dataset, outperforming a baseline that doesn't use the metric.},

Currently, classification consists of supervised machine learning algorithms whose performance is limited by the number of existing annotations of astronomical objects and their highly imbalanced class distributions. In this work, we propose a data augmentation methodology based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate a variety of synthetic light curves from variable stars. Our novel contributions, consisting of a resampling technique and an evaluation metric, can assess the quality of generative models in unbalanced datasets and identify GAN-overfitting cases that the Fr\textbackslash 'echet Inception Distance does not reveal. We applied our proposed model to two datasets taken from the Catalina and Zwicky Transient Facility surveys. The classification accuracy of variable stars is improved significantly when training with synthetic data and testing with real data with respect to the case of using only real data.},

When data contains private and sensitive information, the data owner often desires to publish a synthetic database instance that is similarly useful as the true data, while ensuring the privacy of individual data records. Existing differentially private data synthesis methods aim to generate useful data based on applications, but they fail in keeping one of the most fundamental data properties of the structured data \textemdash{} the underlying correlations and dependencies among tuples and attributes (i.e., the structure of the data). This structure is often expressed as integrity and schema constraints, or with a probabilistic generative process. As a result, the synthesized data is not useful for any downstream tasks that require this structure to be preserved. This work presents Kamino, a data synthesis system to ensure differential privacy and to preserve the structure and correlations present in the original dataset. Kamino takes as input of a database instance, along with its schema (including integrity constraints), and produces a synthetic database instance with differential privacy and structure preservation guarantees. We empirically show that while preserving the structure of the data, Kamino achieves comparable and even better usefulness in applications of training classification models and answering marginal queries than the state-of-the-art methods of differentially private data synthesis.},

  abstract = {After being collected for patient care, Observational Health Data (OHD) can further benefit patient well-being by sustaining the development of health informatics and medical research. Vast potential is unexploited because of the fiercely private nature of patient-related data and regulation about its distribution. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently emerged as a groundbreaking approach to learn generative models efficiently that produce realistic Synthetic Data (SD). They have revolutionized practices in multiple domains such as self-driving cars, fraud detection, simulations in the and marketing industrial sectors known as digital twins, and medical imaging. The digital twin concept could readily apply to modelling and quantifying disease progression. In addition, GANs posses a multitude of capabilities relevant to common problems in the healthcare: augmenting small dataset, correcting class imbalance, domain translation for rare diseases, let alone preserving privacy. Unlocking open access to privacy-preserving OHD could be transformative for scientific research. In the COVID-19's midst, the healthcare system is facing unprecedented challenges, many of which of are data related and could be alleviated by the capabilities of GANs. Considering these facts, publications concerning the development of GAN applied to OHD seemed to be severely lacking. To uncover the reasons for the slow adoption ofGANs for OHD, we broadly reviewed the published literature on the subject. Our findings show that the properties of OHD and eval-uating the SD were initially challenging for the existing GAN algorithms (unlike medical imaging, for which state-of-the-art model were directly transferable) and the choice of metrics ambiguous. We find many publications on the subject, starting slowly in 2017and since then being published at an increasing rate. The difficulties of OHD remain, and we discuss issues relating to evaluation,consistency, benchmarking, data modeling, and reproducibility.},

In addition to the medical device dataset, we also evaluate the GAN-AE performance on two additional datasets and demonstrate the application of GAN-AE to a sequence-to-sequence task where both synthetic sequence inputs and sequence outputs must be generated. To evaluate the quality of the synthetic data, we train encoder-decoder models both with and without the synthetic data and compare the classification model performance.

A major reason for this has been the lack of availability of patient data to the broader ML research community, in large part due to patient privacy protection concerns. High-quality, realistic, synthetic datasets can be leveraged to accelerate methodological developments in medicine. By and large, medical data is high dimensional and often categorical. These characteristics pose multiple modeling challenges. Methods: In this paper, we evaluate three classes of synthetic data generation approaches; probabilistic models, classification-based imputation models, and generative adversarial neural networks. Metrics for evaluating the quality of the generated synthetic datasets are presented and discussed. Results: While the results and discussions are broadly applicable to medical data, for demonstration purposes we generate synthetic datasets for cancer based on the publicly available cancer registry data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. Specifically, our cohort consists of breast, respiratory, and non-solid cancer cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2015, which includes over 360,000 individual cases. Conclusions: We discuss the trade-offs of the different methods and metrics, providing guidance on considerations for the generation and usage of medical synthetic data.},

The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate only poor samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard WGAN and enables stable training of a wide variety of GAN architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language models with continuous generators. We also achieve high quality generations on CIFAR-10 and LSUN bedrooms.},

A slightly different approach is the generation of synthetic data, which tries to preserve the overall properties and characteristics of the original data without revealing information about actual individual data samples. The promise is that, for most purposes, models trained on the synthetic data instead of the real data do not show a significant loss of performance.

It also raises the question of whether guidance can be performed without a classifier. We show that guidance can be indeed performed by a pure generative model without such a classifier: in what we call classifier-free guidance, we jointly train a conditional and an unconditional diffusion model, and we combine the resulting conditional and unconditional score estimates to attain a trade-off between sample quality and diversity similar to that obtained using classifier guidance.},

To optimize this model, we learn a probabilistic inverse for the argmax that lifts the categorical data to a continuous space. Multinomial Diffusion gradually adds categorical noise in a diffusion process, for which the generative denoising process is learned.

This paper presents a comprehensive study conducted to reveal significant inevitabilities of a well organized Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) that aids Smart Home (SH) idea to be implemented. In fact, the viewpoint of this study is to discuss critical issues related to NILM prerequisite necessities, hindered the practical implication of this approach despite improvements during over 30 years. Accordingly, this work presents actual analyses in order to elucidate some arguments using state of the art procedures and results of a semi-synthetic data generator tool. In addition, with the aim of an achievable NILM, we analyze NILM applications from the stakeholders' perspective to assist the choice of employed techniques. Consequently, by investigating crucial intentions of an effective NILM considering current standstill and future progression, the authors propose the Advanced NILM (ANILM) concept and describe its properties to provide an enhanced energy usage system in demand side. In order to meet its ambition, the paper uses a realistic point of view to pinpoint major obstacles toward NILM and elaborate various factors that will make it effectively feasible.},

  abstract = {Imaging bio-markers have been widely used for Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) with Deep Learning (DL). However, the structural brain atrophy is not detectable at an early stage of the disease (namely for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Mild Alzheimer's Disease (MAD)). Indeed, potential biological bio-markers have been proved their ability to early detect brain abnormalities related to AD before brain structural damage and clinical manifestation. Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) provides a promising solution for biological brain changes detection in a no invasive manner. In this paper, we propose an attention-guided supervised DL framework for early AD detection using 1H-MRS data. In the early stages of AD, features may be closely related and often complex to delineate between subjects. Hence, we develop a 1D attention mechanism that explicitly guides the classifier to focus on diagnostically relevant metabolites for classes discrimination. Synthetic data are used to tackle the lack of data problem and to help in learning the feature space. Data used in this paper are collected in the University Hospital of Poitiers, which contained 111 1H-MRS samples extracted from the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) brain region. The data contain 33 Normal Control (NC), 49 MCI due to AD, and 29 MAD subjects. The proposed model achieves an average classification accuracy of 95.23\%. Our framework outperforms state of the art imaging-based approaches, proving the robustness of learning metabolites features against traditional imaging bio-markers for early AD detection.},

First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

An analytic formulation is introduced for the error in albedo-scaled normal estimation with respect to all inputs to the photometric stereo \textendash{} pixel colour, light directions and light-sensor-material interaction. This characterises the error in the estimated normal for all possible directions with respect to the light setup given discrepancies in the inputs. The theoretical formulation is validated by an extensive set of experiments with synthetic data. Example discrepancies in each input to the photometric stereo calculation show a complex distribution of the error of an albedo-scaled normal over the space of possible orientations. This is generalised in the empirical sensitivity analysis which demonstrates that the magnitude of the error propagation from the light directions and the light-sensor-material interaction depends on the surface orientation. However, the image noise is propagated uniformly to all normal directions. There is a linear relationship between the uncertainty in the individual inputs and in the output normals. The theoretical and experimental findings provide several recommendations on designing a capture setup which is the least sensitive to the inaccuracies in the pixel colours, the light directions and the light-sensor-material interaction. An example is provided showing how to assess the inaccuracies in PSCL calculation for a real-world setup.},

Although these inconsistencies can be kept below the scale that is important for visualisation and manufacture, they cause problems for many downstream tasks, making it difficult to use CAD models directly for simulation or advanced geometric analysis, for example. Motivated by this need for watertight models, we address the problem of converting B-rep models to a collection of cubic C1 Clough\textendash Tocher splines. These splines allow a watertight join between B-rep faces, provide a homogeneous representation of shape, and also support local adaptivity. We perform a comparative study of the most prominent Clough\textendash Tocher constructions and include some novel variants. Our criteria include visual fairness, invariance to affine reparameterisations, polynomial precision and approximation error. The constructions are tested on both synthetic data and CAD models that have been triangulated. Our results show that no construction is optimal in every scenario, with surface quality depending heavily on the triangulation and parameterisation that are used.},

  abstract = {Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are currently becoming the leading paradigm of generative modeling for many important data modalities. Being the most prevalent in the computer vision community, diffusion models have also recently gained some attention in other domains, including speech, NLP, and graph-like data. In this work, we investigate if the framework of diffusion models can be advantageous for general tabular problems, where datapoints are typically represented by vectors of heterogeneous features. The inherent heterogeneity of tabular data makes it quite challenging for accurate modeling, since the individual features can be of completely different nature, i.e., some of them can be continuous and some of them can be discrete. To address such data types, we introduce TabDDPM -- a diffusion model that can be universally applied to any tabular dataset and handles any type of feature. We extensively evaluate TabDDPM on a wide set of benchmarks and demonstrate its superiority over existing GAN/VAE alternatives, which is consistent with the advantage of diffusion models in other fields. Additionally, we show that TabDDPM is eligible for privacy-oriented setups, where the original datapoints cannot be publicly shared.},

  abstract = {Tabular generative adversarial networks (TGAN) have recently emerged to cater to the need of synthesizing tabular data \textendash{} the most widely used data format. While synthetic tabular data offers the advantage of complying with privacy regulations, there still exists a risk of privacy leakage via inference attacks due to interpolating the properties of real data during training. Differential private (DP) training algorithms provide theoretical guarantees for training machine learning models by injecting statistical noise to prevent privacy leaks. However, the challenges of applying DP on TGAN are to determine the most optimal framework (i.e., PATE/DP-SGD) and neural network (i.e., Generator/Discriminator)to inject noise such that the data utility is well maintained under a given privacy guarantee. In this paper, we propose DTGAN, a novel conditional Wasserstein tabular GAN that comes in two variants DTGAN\_G and DTGAN\_D, for providing a detailed comparison of tabular GANs trained using DP-SGD for the generator vs discriminator, respectively. We elicit the privacy analysis associated with training the generator with complex loss functions (i.e., classification and information losses) needed for high quality tabular data synthesis. Additionally, we rigorously evaluate the theoretical privacy guarantees offered by DP empirically against membership and attribute inference attacks. Our results on 3 datasets show that the DP-SGD framework is superior to PATE and that a DP discriminator is more optimal for training convergence. Thus, we find (i) DTGAN\_D is capable of maintaining the highest data utility across 4 ML models by up to 18\% in terms of the average precision score for a strict privacy budget, epsilon = 1, as compared to the prior studies and (ii) DP effectively prevents privacy loss against inference attacks by restricting the success probability of membership attacks to be close to 50\%.},

Synthetic tabular data emerges as an alternative to enable data sharing while fulfilling regulatory and privacy constraints. The state-of-the-art tabular data synthesizers draw methodologies from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In this thesis, we develop CTAB-GAN, a novel conditional table GAN architecture that can effectively model diverse data types with complex distributions. CTAB-GAN is extensively evaluated with the state of the art GANs that generate synthetic tables, in terms of data similarity and analysis utility. The results on five datasets show that the synthetic data of CTAB-GAN remarkably resembles the real data for all three types of variables and results in higher accuracy for five machine learning algorithms, by up to 17\%. Additionally, to ensure greater security for training tabular GANs against malicious privacy attacks, differential privacy (DP) is studied and used to train CTAB-GAN with strict privacy guarantees. DP-CTAB-GAN is rigorously evaluated using state-of-the-art DP-tabular GANs in terms of data utility and privacy robustness against membership and attribute inference attacks. Our results on three datasets indicate that strict theoretical differential privacy guarantees come only after severely affecting data utility. However, it is shown empirically that these guarantees help provide a stronger defence against privacy attacks. Overall, it is found that DP-CTABGAN is capable of being robust to privacy attacks while maintaining the highest data utility as compared to prior work, by up to 18\% in terms of the average precision score.},

Key-value pairs in key-value data sets consist of the key and the value. We can construct any kinds of data as key-value data sets by assigning an arbitrary type of data as the value and a unique ID as the key. Therefore, key-value pairs are quite worthy when we deal with big data because the data types in the big data application become more various and, even sometimes, they are not known or determined. In this article, we crawl four kinds of real data sets by varying the type of data sets (i.e., variety) and generate four kinds of synthetic data sets by varying the size of data sets (i.e., volume). For real data sets, we crawl data sets with various data types from Twitter, i.e., Tweets in text, a list of hashtags, geo-location of the tweet, and the number of followers. We also present algorithms for crawling real data sets based on REST APIs and streaming APIs and for generating synthetic data sets. Using those algorithms, we can crawl any key-value pairs of data types supported by Twitter and can generate any size of synthetic data sets by extending them simply. Last, we show that the crawled and generated data sets are actually utilized for the well-known key-value stores such as Level DB of Google, RocksDB of Facebook, and Berkeley DB of Oracle. Actually, the presented real and synthetic data sets have been used for comparing the performance of them. As an example, we present an algorithm of the basic operations for the key-value stores of LevelDB.},

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are considered state-of-the-art for developing generative models. However, these deep learning models are data-driven, and it is, thus, difficult to control the generation process. It can, therefore, lead to the following issues: lack of representativity in the generated data, the introduction of bias, and the possibility of overfitting the sample's noise. This article presents the Directed Acyclic Tabular GAN (DATGAN) to address these limitations by integrating expert knowledge in deep learning models for synthetic tabular data generation. This approach allows the interactions between variables to be specified explicitly using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The DAG is then converted to a network of modified Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to accept multiple inputs. Multiple DATGAN versions are systematically tested on multiple assessment metrics. We show that the best versions of the DATGAN outperform state-of-the-art generative models on multiple case studies. Finally, we show how the DAG can create hypothetical synthetic datasets.},

This is because available data is often limited, incomplete, or cannot be obtained easily, and data privacy is becoming increasingly important. In this work, we present a generalized GAN framework for tabular synthesis, which combines the adversarial training of GANs and the negative log-density regularization of invertible neural networks. The proposed framework can be used for two distinctive objectives. First, we can further improve the synthesis quality, by decreasing the negative log-density of real records in the process of adversarial training. On the other hand, by increasing the negative log-density of real records, realistic fake records can be synthesized in a way that they are not too much close to real records and reduce the chance of potential information leakage. We conduct experiments with real-world datasets for classification, regression, and privacy attacks. In general, the proposed method demonstrates the best synthesis quality (in terms of task-oriented evaluation metrics, e.g., F1) when decreasing the negative log-density during the adversarial training. If increasing the negative log-density, our experimental results show that the distance between real and fake records increases, enhancing robustness against privacy attacks.},

To mitigate such negative effects, several research groups have been working on predicting air quality using deep learning. However, the lack of high-quality air quality datasets is a major obstacle encountered to achieve high accuracy prediction. In this paper, we introduce an air monitoring data generator powered by learning distributed real sequences using the generative adversarial network (GAN), namely AirGen.

To mitigate such negative effects, several research groups have been working on predicting air quality using deep learning. However, the lack of high-quality air quality datasets is a major obstacle encountered to achieve high accuracy prediction. In this paper, we introduce an air monitoring data generator powered by learning distributed real sequences using the generative adversarial network (GAN), namely AirGen.

  abstract = {Designing a generative model to synthesize realistic tabular data is of great significance in data science. Existing tabular data generative models have difficulty in handling complicated and diverse marginal dis-tribution types due to the gradient vanishing problem, and these models pay little attention to the cor-relation between attributes. We propose a method that improves the generative adversarial network (GAN) with inverse cumulative distribution function for tabular data synthesis. This method first trans -forms continuous columns into uniform distribution data by using the cumulative distribution function, which can alleviate the gradient vanishing problem in model training. Then the method trains GAN with the transformed data, where the discriminator with label reconstruction function is presented to model the correlation among attributes accurately by introducing an auxiliary supervised task to help the cor-relations extraction. After that, we train a neural network for each continuous column to perform the inverse transformation of generated data into the target distribution, thereby the synthetic data is obtained. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets show that our method compares favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in modeling tabular data. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

For time-series data, the suite of data augmentation strategies we can use to expand the size of the dataset is limited by the need to maintain the basic properties of the signal.

We elaborate on the model architecture and design strategies. Synthetic sequences generated by our model are indistinguishable from real ones, and can be used to complement or replace real signals of the same type, thus achieving the goal of data augmentation. To evaluate the quality of the generated data, we modify the wavelet coherence metric to be able to compare the similarity between two sets of signals, and also conduct a case study where a mix of synthetic and real data are used to train a deep learning model for sequence classification. Together with other visualization techniques and qualitative evaluation approaches, we demonstrate that TTS-CGAN generated synthetic data are similar to real data, and that our model performs better than the other state-of-the-art GAN models built for time-series data generation.},

Our key insight is that high-dimensional data synthesis can be accomplished by utilizing the domain sizes of attributes, which are public information, whereas identifying the correlation among attributes is necessary but leads to severe privacy budget splitting. In addition, we analytically optimize both the privacy budget allocation and consistency procedures of the proposed method through mathematical programming. We further propose two novel methods, including iterative non-negativity and consistency-aware normalization, to post-process the synthetic data.

  abstract = {Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its variants serve as a perfect representation of the data generation model, providing researchers with a large amount of high-quality generated data. They illustrate a promising direction for research with limited data availability. When GAN learns the semantic-rich data distribution from a dataset, the density of the generated distribution tends to concentrate on the training data. Due to the gradient parameters of the deep neural network contain the data distribution of the training samples, they can easily remember the training samples. When GAN is applied to private or sensitive data, for instance, patient medical records, as private information may be leakage. To address this issue, we propose a Privacy-preserving Generative Adversarial Network (PPGAN) model, in which we achieve differential privacy in GANs by adding well-designed noise to the gradient during the model learning procedure. Besides, we introduced the Moments Accountant strategy in the PPGAN training process to improve the stability and compatibility of the model by controlling privacy loss. We also give a mathematical proof of the differential privacy discriminator. Through extensive case studies of the benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that PPGAN can generate high-quality synthetic data while retaining the required data available under a reasonable privacy budget.},

  abstract = {Accurate long-range forecasting of time series data is an important problem in many sectors, such as energy, healthcare, and finance. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have provided a revolutionary approach to many problems. However, the use of GAN to improve long-range time series forecasting remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we utilize a Conditional Wasserstein GAN (CWGAN) and augment it with an error penalty term, leading to a new generative model which aims to generate high-quality synthetic time series data, called CWGAN-TS. By using such synthetic data, we develop a long-range forecasting approach, called Generative Forecasting (GenF), consisting of three components: (i) CWGAN-TS to generate synthetic data for the next few time steps. (ii) a predictor which makes long-range predictions based on generated and observed data. (iii) an information theoretic clustering (ITC) algorithm to better train the CWGAN-TS and the predictor. Our experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that GenF significantly outperforms a diverse range of state-of-the-art benchmarks and classical approaches. In most cases, we find a 6\% - 12\% improvement in predictive performance (mean absolute error) and a 37\% reduction in parameters compared to the best performing benchmark. Lastly, we conduct an ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CWGAN-TS and the ITC algorithm.},

Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been successful in generating EHR data. However, there are still challenges in high-quality EHR generation, including generating time-series EHR and uncommon diseases given imbalanced datasets. In this work, we propose a Multi-label Time-series GAN (MTGAN) to generate EHR data and simultaneously improve the quality of uncommon disease generation. The generator of MTGAN uses a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with a smooth conditional matrix to generate sequences and uncommon diseases. The critic gives scores using Wasserstein distance to recognize real samples from synthetic samples by considering both data and temporal features. We also propose a training strategy to calculate temporal features for real data and stabilize GAN training. Furthermore, we design multiple statistical metrics and prediction tasks to evaluate the generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the quality of the synthetic data and the effectiveness of MTGAN in generating realistic sequential EHR data, especially for uncommon diseases.},

To address this difficulty, we propose a method to generate realistic synthetic PNRs using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Unlike other GAN applications, PNRs consist of categorical and numerical features with missing/NaN values, which makes the use of GANs challenging. We propose a solution based on Cram\textbackslash '\{e\}r GANs, categorical feature embedding and a Cross-Net architecture. The method was tested on a real PNR dataset, and evaluated in terms of distribution matching, memorization, and performance of predictive models for two real business problems: client segmentation and passenger nationality prediction. Results show that the generated data matches well with the real PNRs without memorizing them, and that it can be used to train models for real business applications.},

To this aim, Machine Learning (ML) components have been proposed as an efficient and effective solution. However, its applicability scope is limited by two important issues: (i) the shortage of network traffic data datasets for attack analysis, and (ii) the data privacy constraints of the data to be used. To overcome these problems, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been proposed for synthetic flow-based network traffic generation. However, due to the ill-convergence of the GAN training, none of the existing solutions can generate high-quality fully synthetic data that can totally substitute real data in the training of ML components. In contrast, they mix real with synthetic data, which acts only as data augmentation components, leading to privacy breaches as real data is used. In sharp contrast, in this work we propose a novel and deterministic way to measure the quality of the synthetic data produced by a GAN both with respect to the real data and to its performance when used for ML tasks. As a by-product, we present a heuristic that uses these metrics for selecting the best performing generator during GAN training, leading to a novel stopping criterion, which can be applied even when different types of synthetic data are to be used in the same ML task. We demonstrate the adequacy of our proposal by generating synthetic cryptomining attacks and normal traffic flow-based data using an enhanced version of a Wasserstein GAN. The results evidence that the generated synthetic network traffic can completely replace real data when training a ML-based cryptomining detector, obtaining similar performance and avoiding privacy violations, since real data is not used in the training of the ML-based detector.},

  abstract = {Differentially private GANs have proven to be a promising approach for generating realistic synthetic data without compromising the privacy of individuals. Due to the privacy-protective noise introduced in the training, the convergence of GANs becomes even more elusive, which often leads to poor utility in the output generator at the end of training. We propose Private post-GAN boosting (Private PGB), a differentially private method that combines samples produced by the sequence of generators obtained during GAN training to create a high-quality synthetic dataset. To that end, our method leverages the Private Multiplicative Weights method (Hardt and Rothblum, 2010) to reweight generated samples. We evaluate Private PGB on two dimensional toy data, MNIST images, US Census data and a standard machine learning prediction task. Our experiments show that Private PGB improves upon a standard private GAN approach across a collection of quality measures. We also provide a non-private variant of PGB that improves the data quality of standard GAN training.},

We show that with a few simple modifications, DDPMs can also achieve competitive log-likelihoods while maintaining high sample quality. Additionally, we find that learning variances of the reverse diffusion process allows sampling with an order of magnitude fewer forward passes with a negligible difference in sample quality, which is important for the practical deployment of these models. We additionally use precision and recall to compare how well DDPMs and GANs cover the target distribution.

As a case study, we examine the performance of 16 GAN variants on six multivariate distributions of varying dimensionalities and training set sizes. In this learning environment, we observe that: GANs exhibit similar performance trends across dimensionalities; learning depends on the underlying distribution and its complexity; the number of training samples can have a large impact on performance; evaluation and relative comparisons are metric-dependent; diverse sets of hyperparameters can produce a "best" result; and some GANs are more robust to hyperparameter changes than others. These observations both corroborate findings of previous GAN evaluation studies and make novel contributions regarding the relationship between size, complexity, and GAN performance.},

  abstract = {Privacy is an important concern for our society where sharing data with partners or releasing data to the public is a frequent occurrence. Some of the techniques that are being used to achieve privacy are to remove identifiers, alter quasi-identifiers, and perturb values. Unfortunately, these approaches suffer from two limitations. First, it has been shown that private information can still be leaked if attackers possess some background knowledge or other information sources. Second, they do not take into account the adverse impact these methods will have on the utility of the released data. In this paper, we propose a method that meets both requirements. Our method, called table-GAN, uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize fake tables that are statistically similar to the original table yet do not incur information leakage. We show that the machine learning models trained using our synthetic tables exhibit performance that is similar to that of models trained using the original table for unknown testing cases. We call this property model compatibility. We believe that anonymization/perturbation/synthesis methods without model compatibility are of little value. We used four real-world datasets from four different domains for our experiments and conducted indepth comparisons with state-of-the-art anonymization, perturbation, and generation techniques. Throughout our experiments, only our method consistently shows balance between privacy level and model compatibility.},

The effect of DP on the fairness of the resulting trained models is not yet well understood. In this contribution, we systematically study the effects of differentially private synthetic data generation on classification. We analyze disparities in model utility and bias caused by the synthetic dataset, measured through algorithmic fairness metrics. Our first set of results show that although there seems to be a clear negative correlation between privacy and utility (the more private, the less accurate) across all data synthesizers we evaluated, more privacy does not necessarily imply more bias. Additionally, we assess the effects of utilizing synthetic datasets for model training and model evaluation. We show that results obtained on synthetic data can misestimate the actual model performance when it is deployed on real data. We hence advocate on the need for defining proper testing protocols in scenarios where differentially private synthetic datasets are utilized for model training and evaluation.},

Despite a long and rich history of remonstrations in the literature, several very recent publications evaluating Hg-related BAFs have suffered from false conclusions based on spurious correlation, and thus it seems that periodic reminders of the causes and risks of these errors are required. Herein we cite examples and explanations for unsupported conclusions from publications where authors using BAF-Cw relationships fail to recognize the underlying statistical significance (or lack thereof) of direct relationships between Cw and Cbiota. This fundamental error leads to other problems, including ascribing mechanistic significance (e.g., mechanisms related to biota contaminant uptake) to ``inverse'' BAF-Cw relationships that reflect nothing more than regressing the log transformed inverse of Cw (i.e., negative log) against itself (i.e., positive log transformed), and using such regression models of BAF-Cw relationships that appear significant for predictive purposes, but are misleading. Spurious correlation arising in the analysis of BAF relationships can potentially appear in more subtle forms as well, including regressing variables such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that are correlated with Cw. We conclude that conducting a direct analysis by examining the relationship between Cbiota and Cw (or Cbiota and other variables) rather than evaluating a ratio (BAF) is less ambiguous and subject to error, more easily interpreted, and would lead to more supportable conclusions.},

In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network for tabular data generation. The model includes two phases of training. In the first phase, the model is trained to accurately generate synthetic data similar to the reference dataset. In the second phase we modify the value function to add fairness constraint, and continue training the network to generate data that is both accurate and fair. We test our results in both cases of unconstrained, and constrained fair data generation. In the unconstrained case, i.e. when the model is only trained in the first phase and is only meant to generate accurate data following the same joint probability distribution of the real data, the results show that the model beats state-of-the-art GANs proposed in the literature to produce synthetic tabular data. Also, in the constrained case in which the first phase of training is followed by the second phase, we train the network and test it on four datasets studied in the fairness literature and compare our results with another state-of-the-art pre-processing method, and present the promising results that it achieves. Comparing to other studies utilizing GANs for fair data generation, our model is comparably more stable by using only one critic, and also by avoiding major problems of original GAN model, such as mode-dropping and non-convergence, by implementing a Wasserstein GAN.},

Computational modeling and simulation (M\&S) enables engineers to avoid many of the challenges encountered in traditional design engineering, including the design, manufacture, and testing of expensive prototypes prior to having an optimized design. However, the use of M\&S carries its own challenges, such as the computational time and resources required to execute effective studies, and uncertainties arising from simplifying assumptions inherent to computer models, which are intended to be an approximate representation of reality. In recent year advances have been made in a number of areas related to the efficient and reliable use of M\&S for system evaluations, including design \& analysis of computer experiments, uncertainty quantification, probabilistic analysis, response optimization, and data synthesis techniques. In this review paper, a general framework for systematically executing efficient M\&S studies at the component-level, product-level, system-level, and system-of-systems-level is described. A case study is used to demonstrate how statistical and probabilistic techniques can be integrated with M\&S to address those challenges inherent to model-based engineering, and how this aligns with the proposed workflow. The example is a gun-launch dynamics model of an artillery projectile developed by US Army engineers, and illustrates the application of this workflow in the study of subsystem system reliability, performance, and end-to-end system-level characterization.},

Furthermore, we used five key statistical parameters to describe the smart grid data distribution and compared them between synthetic data generated by both models and real data. Experiments indicate that the proposed synthetic data generative model outperforms the vanilla GAN network. The distribution of VAE-GAN synthetic data is the most comparable to that of real data.},

Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs. Code is available at https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion .},

  abstract = {In the present and future, data is the most valuable thing in the world. Therefore, it is now a challenge for everyone in every sector to work with data. Collecting data to predict or collecting data to analyze is a very valuable task. Moreover every new research, new machine learning method, and algorithms testing depends on a massive amount of different data. Furthermore, it is also a security issue for many fields to share actual data. It is always hard to find the perfect data set. It is not just about figuring out huge amounts of data. Many other data analysis processes need to be performed on that dataset to make it worthwhile. To overcome this problem, data augmentation is one of the suitable solutions. The idea behind data augmentation is to create a new dataset that depends on some existing dataset features. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. They are a game-like way to learn and generate new datasets. GANs have two parts, one is the generator, and the second is the discriminator. They play against each other to win the game. We will use our data set on the GAN model using some specific hyperparameter value and optimizer, which we will find out through our experiment. Finally, we will produce a CSV file with model-generated synthesis data and visualize the performance statistic of our model in the graph. This article will explain the different facts related to Data Augmentation, and GANs.},

  abstract = {Data is commonly stored in tabular format. Several fields of research (e.g., biomedical, fault/fraud detection), are prone to small imbalanced tabular data. Supervised Machine Learning on such data is often difficult due to class imbalance, adding further to the challenge. Synthetic data generation i.e. oversampling is a common remedy used to improve classifier performance. State-of-the-art linear interpolation approaches, such as LoRAS and ProWRAS can be used to generate synthetic samples from the convex space of the minority class to improve classifier performance in such cases. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are common deep learning approaches for synthetic sample generation. Although GANs are widely used for synthetic image generation, their scope on tabular data in the context of imbalanced classification is not adequately explored. In this article, we show that existing deep generative models perform poorly compared to linear interpolation approaches generating synthetic samples from the convex space of the minority class, for imbalanced classification problems on tabular datasets of small size. We propose a deep generative model, ConvGeN combining the idea of convex space learning and deep generative models. ConVGeN learns the coefficients for the convex combinations of the minority class samples, such that the synthetic data is distinct enough from the majority class. We demonstrate that our proposed model ConvGeN improves imbalanced classification on such small datasets, as compared to existing deep generative models while being at par with the existing linear interpolation approaches. Moreover, we discuss how our model can be used for synthetic tabular data generation in general, even outside the scope of data imbalance, and thus, improves the overall applicability of convex space learning.},

  abstract = {Generating multivariate time series is a promising approach for sharing sensitive data in many medical, financial, and IoT applications. A common type of multivariate time series originates from a single source such as the biometric measurements from a medical patient. This leads to complex dynamical patterns between individual time series that are hard to learn by typical generation models such as GANs. There is valuable information in those patterns that machine learning models can use to better classify, predict or perform other downstream tasks. We propose a novel framework that takes time series' common origin into account and favors inter-channel relationship preservation. The two key points of our method are: 1) the individual time series are generated from a common point in latent space and 2) a central discriminator favors the preservation of inter-channel dynamics. We demonstrate empirically that our method helps preserve channel correlations and that our synthetic data performs very well downstream tasks with medical and financial data.},

  abstract = {With the advent of information technology, the amount of online data generation has been massive. Recommendation systems have become an effective tool in filtering information and solving the problem of information overload. Machine learning algorithms to build these recommendation systems require well-balanced data in terms of class distribution, but real-world datasets are mostly imbalanced in nature. Imbalanced data imposes a classifier to focus more on the majority class, neglecting other classes of interests and thus hindering the predictive performance of any classification model. There exist many traditional techniques for oversampling minority classes. Still, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have been showing excellent results in generating realistic synthetic tabular data that keeps the probability distribution of the original data intact. In this paper, we propose a hybrid GAN approach to solve the data imbalance problem to enhance recommendation systems' performance. We implemented conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty to generate tabular data containing both numerical and categorical values. We also augmented auxiliary classifier loss to enforce the model to explicitly generate data belonging to the minority class. We designed the discriminator architecture with the concept of PacGAN to receive m-packed samples as input instead of a single input. This inclusion of the PacGAN architecture eliminated the mode collapse problem in our proposed model. We did a two-fold evaluation of our model. Firstly based on the quality of the generated data and secondly on how different recommendation models perform using the generated data compared to original data. \textcopyright{} 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, a new methodology is advanced to incorporate the uncertainties associated with RE resources and load in sizing an HRES in the application of buildings with low to high renewable energy ratio (RER). Dynamic multi-objective particle swarm optimization (DMOPSO) algorithm, simulation module, and sampling average technique are used to approximate a Pareto front (PF) for an HRES design through a multi-objective optimization framework. The main aim of design is to simultaneously minimize total net present cost (NPC), maximize renewable energy ratio, and minimize fuel emission while satisfy a desirable level of loss of load probability (LLP). The existing randomness in wind speed, solar irradiation, ambient temperature, and energy load is considered using synthetically data generation and sampling average method. The performance of the model has been examined in a building located in Canada as the case study, in which RER of the building is increased by using renewable energy technologies. The generated PF by the stochastic approach is compared to a deterministic PF using well-known performance metrics. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is carried out where the economic characteristics of the model are varied.},

  abstract = {Multimodal fusion is becoming more common as it proves to be a powerful approach to identify complementary information from multimodal datasets. However, simulation of joint information is not straightforward. Published approaches mostly employ limited, provisional designs that often break the link between the model assumptions and the data for the sake of demonstrating properties of fusion techniques. This work introduces a new approach to synthetic data generation which allows full-compliance between data and model while still representing realistic spatiotemporal features in accordance with the current neuroimaging literature. The focus is on the simulation of joint information for the verification of stochastic linear models, particularly those used in multimodal data fusion of brain imaging data. Our first goal is to obtain a benchmark ground-truth in which estimation errors due to model mismatch are minimal or none. Then we move on to assess how estimation is affected by gradually increasing model discrepancies toward a more realistic dataset. The key aspect of our approach is that it permits complete control over the type and level of model mismatch, allowing for more educated inferences about the limitations and caveats of select stochastic linear models. As a result, impartial comparison of models is possible based on their performance in multiple different scenarios. Our proposed method uses the commonly overlooked theory of copulas to enable full control of the type and level of dependence/association between modalities, with no occurrence of spurious multimodal associations. Moreover, our approach allows for arbitrary single-modality marginal distributions for any fixed choice of dependence/association between multimodal features. Using our simulation framework, we can rigorously challenge the assumptions of several existing multimodal fusion approaches. Our study brings a new perspective to the problem of simulating multimodal data that can be used for ground-truth verification of various stochastic multimodal models available in the literature, and reveals some important aspects that are not captured or are overlooked by ad hoc simulations that lack a firm statistical motivation.},

One of the recently proposed models in the field of tabular data generation, CTGAN, demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on this task even in the presence of a high class imbalance in categorical columns or multiple modes in continuous columns. Many of the recently proposed methods have also derived ideas from CTGAN. However, training CTGAN requires a high memory footprint while dealing with high cardinality categorical columns in the dataset. In this paper, we propose MeTGAN, a memory-efficient version of CTGAN, which reduces memory usage by roughly 80\%, with a minimal effect on performance. MeTGAN uses sparse linear layers to overcome the memory bottlenecks of CTGAN. We compare the performance of MeTGAN with the other models on publicly available datasets. Quality of data generation, memory requirements, and the privacy guarantees of the models are the metrics considered in this study. The goal of this paper is also to draw the attention of the research community on the issue of the computational footprint of tabular data generation methods to enable them on larger datasets especially ones with high cardinality categorical variables.},

Recently, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been an out-performing and well-established model in the task of Grammar Error Correction (GEC). Arabic GEC is still growing because of some challenges, such as scarcity of training sets and the complexity of Arabic language. To overcome these issues, we introduced an unsupervised method to generate large-scale synthetic training data based on confusion function to increase the amount of training set. Furthermore, we introduced a supervised NMT model for AGEC called SCUT AGEC. SCUT AGEC is a convolutional sequence-to-sequence model consisting of nine encoder-decoder layers with attention mechanism. We applied fine-tuning to improve the performance and get more efficient results. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) gives our model ability to joint feature extraction and classification in one task and we proved that it is an efficient way to capture features of the local context. Moreover, it is easy to obtain long-term dependencies because of convolutional layers staking. Our proposed model becomes the first supervised AGEC system based on the convolutional sequence-to-sequence learning to outperforms the current state-of-the-art neural AGEC models.},

DP-CGANS distinguishes categorical and continuous variables and transforms them to latent space separately. Then, we structure a conditional vector as an additional input to not only presents the minority class in the imbalanced data, but also capture the dependency between variables. We inject statistical noise to the gradients in the networking training process of DP-CGANS to provide a differential privacy guarantee. We extensively evaluate our model with state-of-the-art generative models on three public datasets and two real-world personal health datasets in terms of statistical similarity, machine learning performance, and privacy measurement.

To demonstrate the model fidelity, we show that CorGAN generates synthetic data with performance similar to that of real data in various Machine Learning settings such as classification and prediction.

  abstract = {Deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in several application problems, such as image classification and speech processing. However, creating a deep learning model using health record data requires addressing certain privacy challenges that bring unique concerns to researchers working in this domain. One effective way to handle such private data issues is to generate realistic synthetic data that can provide practically acceptable data quality and correspondingly the model performance. To tackle this challenge, we develop a differentially private framework for synthetic data generation using R\textbackslash 'enyi differential privacy. Our approach builds on convolutional autoencoders and convolutional generative adversarial networks to preserve some of the critical characteristics of the generated synthetic data. In addition, our model can also capture the temporal information and feature correlations that might be present in the original data. We demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models under the same privacy budget using several publicly available benchmark medical datasets in both supervised and unsupervised settings.},

To create gold standard explanations, we present a definition of feature relevance in Boolean functions.

This kind of procedures imply for the clinicians to infer the 3D shape of the device from 2D images, which is known to be an ill-posed problem. In this paper we present a method to reconstruct the 3D shape of the interventional device, with the aim of improving the navigation. The method combines a physics-based simulation with non-linear Bayesian filter. Whereas the physics-based model provides a prediction of the shape of the device navigating within the blood vessels (taking into account non-linear interactions between the catheter and the surrounding anatomy), an Unscented Kalman Filter is used to correct the navigation model using 2D image features as external observations. The proposed framework has been evaluated on both synthetic and real data, under different model parameterizations, filter parameters tuning and external observations data-sets. Comparing the reconstructed 3D shape with a known ground truth, for the synthetic data-set, we obtained average values for 3D Hausdorff Distance of 0.81{$\pm$}0.53mm, for the 3D mean distance at the segment of 0.37{$\pm$}0.17mm and an average 3D tip error of 0.24{$\pm$}0.13mm. For the real data-set,we obtained an average 3D Hausdorff distance of 1.74{$\pm$}0.77mm, a average 3D mean distance at the distal segment of 0.91{$\pm$}0.14mm, an average 3D error on the tip of 0.53{$\pm$}0.09mm. These results show the ability of our method to retrieve the 3D shape of the device, under a variety of filter parameterizations and challenging conditions: uncertainties on model parameterization, ambiguous views and non-linear complex phenomena such as stick and slip motions.},

  abstract = {A powerful approach, and one of the most common ones in structural health monitoring (SHM), is to use data-driven models to make predictions and inferences about structures and their condition. Such methods almost exclusively rely on the quality of the data. Within the SHM discipline, data do not always suffice to build models with satisfactory accuracy for given tasks. Even worse, data may be completely missing from one's dataset, regarding the behaviour of a structure under different environmental conditions. In the current work, with a view to confronting such issues, the generation of artificial data using a variation of the generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithm, is used. The aforementioned variation is that of the conditional GAN or cGAN. The algorithm is not only used to generate artificial data, but also to learn transformations of manifolds according to some known parameters. Assuming that the structure's response is represented by points in a manifold, part of the space will be formed due to variations in external conditions affecting the structure. This idea proves efficient in SHM, as it is exploited to generate structural data for specific values of environmental coefficients. The scheme is applied here on a simulated structure which operates under different temperature and humidity conditions. The cGAN is trained on data for some discrete values of the temperature within some range, and is able to generate data for every temperature in this range with satisfactory accuracy. The novelty, compared to classic regression in similar problems, is that the cGAN allows unknown environmental parameters to affect the structure and can generate whole manifolds of data for every value of the known parameters, while the unknown ones vary within the generated manifolds.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {Synthetic data generation becomes prevalent as a solution to privacy leakage and data shortage. Generative models are designed to generate a realistic synthetic dataset, which can precisely express the data distribution for the real dataset. The generative adversarial networks (GAN), which gain great success in the computer vision fields, are doubtlessly used for synthetic data generation. Though there are prior works that have demonstrated great progress, most of them learn the correlations in the data distributions rather than the true processes in which the datasets are naturally generated. Correlation is not reliable for it is a statistical technique that only tells linear dependencies and is easily affected by the dataset's bias. Causality, which encodes all underlying factors of how the real data be naturally generated, is more reliable than correlation. In this work, we propose a causal model named Causal Tabular Generative Neural Network (Causal-TGAN) to generate synthetic tabular data using the tabular data's causal information. Extensive experiments on both simulated datasets and real datasets demonstrate the better performance of our method when given the true causal graph and a comparable performance when using the estimated causal graph.},

First, real data that might be considered good for testing analytic applications may not be available or may be classified. In the latter case, tool builders will not have the clearances needed to use, or even see, the data. Second, analysts' time is scarce and obtaining the needed characteristics of real data from them to create a test data set is difficult. Finally, generating good test data is challenging. Commercial data generators are focused on large database testing, not information analytics tool testing. Our distinctive contribution is that we embed known ground truth in a test data set, so that tool developers and others will be able to determine the effectiveness of their software and how they are progressing in their support for information analysts. Our automated methods also significantly decrease data set development time. We review our approach to scenario development, threat insertion strategies, data set development, and data set evaluation. We also discuss our recent successes in using our data in open analytic competitions.},

To protect confidential data, some cells are suppressed in the publicly released data. One problem with this method is that many cells of interest must be suppressed in order to protect a much smaller number of sensitive cells. Another problem is that the covariates used to aggregate and level of aggregation must be fixed before the data is released. Both of these restrictions can severely limit the utility of the data. We propose a new disclosure limitation method that replaces the full set of microdata with synthetic data for use in producing released data in tabular form. This synthetic data set is obtained by replacing each unit's values with a weighted average of sampled values from the surrounding area. The synthetic data is produced in a way to give asymptotically unbiased estimates for aggregate cells as the number of units in the cell increases. The method is applied to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages data, which is released to the public quarterly in tabular form and aggregated across varying scales of time, area, and economic sector.},

The model is used to estimate the underlying distribution of a dataset and randomly generate realistic samples according to their estimated distribution. However, GANs can easily remember training samples due to the high model complexity of deep networks. When GANs are applied to private or sensitive data, the concentration of distribution may divulge some critical information. It consequently requires new technological advances to mitigate the information leakage under GANs. To address this issue, we propose GANobfuscator, a differentially private GAN, which can achieve differential privacy under GANs by adding carefully designed noise to gradients during the learning procedure. With GANobfuscator, analysts are able to generate an unlimited amount of synthetic data for arbitrary analysis tasks without disclosing the privacy of training data. Moreover, we theoretically prove that GANobfuscator can provide strict privacy guarantee with differential privacy. In addition, we develop a gradient-pruning strategy for GANobfuscator to improve the scalability and stability of data training. Through extensive experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that GANobfuscator can produce high-quality generated data and retain desirable utility under practical privacy budgets.},

  abstract = {In data mining, common classification algorithms cannot effectively learn from imbalanced data. Oversampling addresses this problem by creating data for the minority class in order to balance the class distribution before the model is trained. The Traditional oversampling approaches are based on Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE), which focus on local information but generates insufficiently realistic data. In contrast, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) captures the true data distribution in order to generate data for the minority class. However, both approaches are problematic owing to mode collapse and unstable training. To overcome these problems, we propose Conditional Wasserstein GAN- Gradient Penalty (CWGAN-GP), a novel and efficient synthetic oversampling approach for imbalanced datasets, which can be constructed by adding auxiliary conditional information to the WGAN-GP. CWGAN-GP generates more realistic data and overcomes the aforementioned problems. Experiments on 15 different benchmarked datasets and two real imbalanced datasets empirically demonstrate that CWGAN-GP increases the quality of synthetic data; furthermore, our approach outperforms the other oversampling approaches based on three evaluation metrics (F-measure, G-mean, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) for five classifiers. Friedman and Nemenyi post hoc statistical tests also confirm that CWGAN-GP is superior to the other oversampling approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The characteristic association between transaction sequences can be learned by long short-term memory layer, and the generator covers real data distribution by the adversarial discriminator with time-sequence. Mapping data distribution to feature space is a common evaluation method of synthetic data; however, relationships between data attributes have been ignored in online transactions. We define a comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the validity of generated samples from data distribution and attribute characteristics. Experimental results on real bank B2B transaction data show that the proposed model has higher overall ratings, which is 10\% higher than traditional generation models. Finally, well-trained model is used to generate negative samples and form new dataset. The classification results on new datasets show that precision and recall are all higher than baseline models.

Motivated by this, we propose a novel idea that combining differential privacy and generative adversarial nets. Generative adversarial nets and its extensions are used to generate a synthetic dataset with indistinguishable statistic features while differential privacy guarantees a trade-off between privacy protection and data utility. By employing a min-max game with three players, we devise a deep generative model, namely DP-GAN model, for synthetic data generation while fulfilling the privacy constraints in a differentially private manner.

  abstract = {The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in the medical world is growing, with a range of purposes: from the identification and prediction of possible diseases to patient monitoring and clinical decision support systems. Furthermore, the widespread use of remote monitoring medical devices, under the umbrella of the ``Internet of Medical Things'' (IoMT), has simplified the retrieval of patient information as they allow continuous monitoring and direct access to data by healthcare providers. However, due to possible issues in real-world settings, such as loss of connectivity, irregular use, misuse, or poor adherence to a monitoring program, the data collected might not be sufficient to implement accurate algorithms. For this reason, data augmentation techniques can be used to create synthetic datasets sufficiently large to train machine learning models. In this work, we apply the concept of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform a data augmentation from patient data obtained through IoMT sensors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) monitoring. We also apply an explainable AI algorithm to demonstrate the accuracy of the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data recorded by the sensors. The results obtained demonstrate how synthetic datasets created through a well-structured GAN are comparable with a real dataset, as validated by a novel approach based on machine learning.},

Three widely employed measures are information-theoretic divergences, integral probability metrics, and Hilbert space discrepancy metrics. We elucidate the theoretical connections between these three popular GAN training criteria and propose a novel procedure, called chi(2)-GAN, that is conceptually simple, stable at training and resistant to mode collapse. Our procedure naturally generalizes to address the problem of simultaneous matching of multiple distributions. Further, we propose a resampling strategy that significantly improves sample quality, by repurposing the trained critic function via an importance weighting mechanism.

However, obtaining energy consumption data has two major challenges: (i) data collection is very expensive, time-consuming, and (ii) security and privacy concern of the users which can be revealed from the actual data. In this research, we have addressed these challenges by using generative adversarial networks for generating energy consumption profile. We have successfully generated synthetic data which is similar to the real energy consumption data. On the basis of the recent research conducted on TimeGAN, we have implemented a framework for synthetic energy consumption data generation that could be useful in research, data analysis and create business solutions. The framework is implemented using the real-world energy dataset, consisting of energy consumption data of the year 2020 for the Australian states of Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. The results of implementation is evaluated using various performance measures and the results are showcased using visualizations along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (TSNE) plots. Overall, experimental results show that Synthetic data generated using the proposed implementation possess very similar characteristics to the real dataset with high comparison accuracy.},

Most existing methods exploit seen-to-unseen correlation via learning a projection between visual and semantic spaces. However, such projection-based paradigms cannot fully utilize the discriminative information implied in data distribution, and commonly suffer from the information degradation issue caused by ``heterogeneity gap''. In this paper, we propose a visual data synthesis framework via GAN to address these problems. Specifically, both semantic knowledge and visual distribution are leveraged to synthesize video feature of unseen categories, and ZSL can be turned into typical supervised problem with the synthetic features. First, we propose multi-level semantic inference to boost video feature synthesis, which captures the discriminative information implied in joint visual-semantic distribution via feature-level and label-level semantic inference. Second, we propose Matching-aware Mutual Information Correlation to overcome information degradation issue, which captures seen-to-unseen correlation in matched and mismatched visual-semantic pairs by mutual information, providing the zero-shot synthesis procedure with robust guidance signals. Experimental results on four video datasets demonstrate that our approach can improve the zero-shot video classification performance significantly.},

Based on the data collected in condition monitoring, the degradation of the part is predicted. Studies show that most failures are caused by faults in rolling element bearing, which highlights that a bearing is one of the most important mechanical components of any machine. Thus, it becomes important to monitor bearing degradation to make sure that it is utilized properly. Generally, machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) techniques are utilized to predict bearing degradation using a data-driven approach, where signals are captured from the machine. There should be a large amount of data to apply either ML or DL techniques, but it is difficult to collect that amount of data directly from any machine. In this study, health assessment is carried out using the correlation coefficient to divide the bearing life into two degradation stages. The raw signal is processed using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), where mutual information (MI) is used to rank and select the base wavelet, after which tabular generative adversarial networks (TGAN) are used to generate the artificial coefficients. Statistical features are calculated from the real data (DWT coefficients) and the artificial data (generated from TGAN). The constructed feature vector is then used as an input to train machine learning models, namely ensemble bagged tree (EBT) and Gaussian process regression with the squared exponential kernel function (SEGPR), to estimate bearing degradation conditions. Both the machine learning models were validated on the publicly available experimental data of FEMTO bearing. Obtained results showed that the developed EBT and SEGPR models accurately predicted the bearing degradation conditions with the average lowest RMSE value of 0.0045 and MAE value of 0.0037.},

When the target dataset has missing data, then it is common to just discard incomplete observations, even though this necessarily means some loss of information. However, when the proportion of missing data are large, discarding incomplete observations may not leave enough data to accurately estimate their joint distribution. Thus, there is a need for data synthesis methods capable of using datasets with missing data, to improve accuracy and, in more extreme cases, to make data synthesis possible. To achieve this, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) called MaWGAN (for masked Wasserstein GAN), which creates synthetic data directly from datasets with missing values. As with existing GAN approaches, the MaWGAN synthetic data generator generates samples from the full joint distribution. We introduce a novel methodology for comparing the generator output with the original data that does not require us to discard incomplete observations, based on a modification of the Wasserstein distance and easily implemented using masks generated from the pattern of missing data in the original dataset. Numerical experiments are used to demonstrate the superior performance of MaWGAN compared to (a) discarding incomplete observations before using a GAN, and (b) imputing missing values (using the GAIN algorithm) before using a GAN.},

The study shows that the proposed approach selects salient biomedical entities and values from structured data with improved precision (up to 0.13 absolute increase) of copying the tabular values to generate coherent and accurate text for assay validation reports and toxicology reports. Moreover, we also demonstrate a light-weight adaptation of the proposed system to new datasets by fine-tuning with as little as 40\textbackslash\% training examples.

To address this problem, we developed a new data synthesis method that preserves the correlation (between features) observed in the original dataset. This preservation was realized by considering not only the correlation but also the random noises used in data synthesis process. This method was applied to various biosignals (i.e., electrocortiography, electromyogram, and electrocardiogram), wherein data points are insufficient. Several classifiers (i.e., convolutional neural network, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor) were used to verify that the classification accuracy can be improved by the proposed data synthesis method.},

  abstract = {Lack of accurate and complete utility records is a root cause of utility strikes that occur on average once every minute in the United States, leading to hundreds of deaths and billions of dollars in financial losses. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has emerged as a promising tool to detect, locate, and measure underground pipes. Many algorithms have been devised to process GPR scans to determine pipe location and burying depth. Their accuracy depends on the relative angles between the GPR survey trajectory and the buried pipes. Perpendicular-to-pipe scanning yields the highest detectability, and along-pipe scanning yields the highest planimetric and depth accuracy. However, the challenge in practice is to maintain such ideal angles while not knowing the exact orientation of the pipes. This paper devises a novel spatial reasoning mechanism to enable the automation of GPR survey trajectory planning and adjustment based on ill-shaped and incomplete GPR signatures to achieve ideal angles in real time. The spatial reasoning mechanism provides trajectory adjustment suggestions based on the connection between the GPR signatures extracted from GPR scans and the relative angles between the GPR trajectory and underground pipes. The adjustment process continues until the GPR signatures from synthetic data under ideal angles and from field survey converge, and further adjustment no longer improves the results. Both indoor and field experiments have been conducted for validation. The results show that the newly developed method is capable of guiding the adjustment process in real time to achieve ideal angles and collect high-quality GPR data, leading to a more accurate estimation of pipe locations and burying depths. It has the great potential to support the operation of robotic unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) or unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to fully automate the GPR field survey.},

The data processing and analysis of the traditional Internet of Things system are inefficient and cannot handle such a large number of data streams. In addition, the IoT smart device has a resource-limited feature, which cannot be ignored when analyzing data. This paper proposes a new architecture ApproxECIoT (Approximate Edge Computing Internet of Things, ApproxECIoT) suitable for real-time data stream processing of the Internet of Things. It implements a self-adjusting stratified sampling algorithm to process real-time data streams. The algorithm adjusts the size of the sample stratums according to the variance of each stratum while maintaining the given memory budget. This is beneficial to improve the accuracy of the calculation results when resources are limited. Finally, the experimental analysis was performed using synthetic datasets and real-world datasets, the results show that ApproxECIoT can still obtain high-accuracy calculation results when using memory resources similar to simple random sampling. In the case of synthetic data streams, when the sampling ratio is 10\%, compared with CalculIoT, the accuracy loss of ApproxECIoT is reduced by 89.6\%; compared with SRS, the accuracy loss of ApprxoECIoT is reduced by 99.8\%. In the case of using the real data stream of the wireless sensor network, the performance of ApproxECIoT is not the best, but as the sampling ratio increases, the accuracy loss of ApproxECIoT decreases more than other frameworks.},

Synthetic tabular data emerges as an alternative to enable data sharing while fulfilling regulatory and privacy constraints. The state-of-the-art tabular data synthesizers draw methodologies from generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and address two main data types in the industry, i.e., continuous and categorical. In this paper, we develop CTAB-GAN, a novel conditional table GAN architecture that can effectively model diverse data types, including a mix of continuous and categorical variables. Moreover, we address data imbalance and long-tail issues, i.e., certain variables have drastic frequency differences across large values. To achieve those aims, we first introduce the information loss and classification loss to the conditional GAN. Secondly, we design a novel conditional vector, which efficiently encodes the mixed data type and skewed distribution of data variable. We extensively evaluate CTAB-GAN with the state of the art GANs that generate synthetic tables, in terms of data similarity and analysis utility. The results on five datasets show that the synthetic data of CTAB-GAN remarkably resembles the real data for all three types of variables and results into higher accuracy for five machine learning algorithms, by up to 17\%.},

  abstract = {While data sharing is crucial for knowledge development, privacy concerns and strict regulation (e.g., European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) limit its full effectiveness. Synthetic tabular data emerges as alternative to enable data sharing while fulfilling regulatory and privacy constraints. State-of-the-art tabular data synthesizers draw methodologies from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). As GANs improve the synthesized data increasingly resemble the real data risking to leak privacy. Differential privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees on privacy loss but degrades data utility. Striking the best trade-off remains yet a challenging research question. We propose CTAB-GAN+ a novel conditional tabular GAN. CTAB-GAN+ improves upon state-of-the-art by (i) adding downstream losses to conditional GANs for higher utility synthetic data in both classification and regression domains; (ii) using Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty for better training convergence; (iii) introducing novel encoders targeting mixed continuous-categorical variables and variables with unbalanced or skewed data; and (iv) training with DP stochastic gradient descent to impose strict privacy guarantees. We extensively evaluate CTAB-GAN+ on data similarity and analysis utility against state-of-the-art tabular GANs. The results show that CTAB-GAN+ synthesizes privacy-preserving data with at least 48.16\% higher utility across multiple datasets and learning tasks under different privacy budgets.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a machine learning-based approach to synthetically creating realistic phasor measurement unit (PMU) data streams of multiple transient types. In contrast to the existing literature of transient simulation-based data generation methods, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based approach to learning directly from the historical data and simultaneously reproduce multiple PMU data streams. The synthetic PMU data streams reflect meaningful dynamic characteristics which observe first principles such as Kirchhoff's laws. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by numerical studies on the IEEE 39-bus system. We validate the fidelity and flexibility of the synthetic data via statistical resemblance and modal analysis approaches. Finally we illustrate a practical application scenario for the usage of the synthetic PMU data, i.e. leverage the synthetic data to improve the performance of the event classification algorithms.},

  abstract = {Missing value imputation in machine learning is the task of estimating the missing values in the dataset accurately using available information. In this task, several deep generative modeling methods have been proposed and demonstrated their usefulness, e.g., generative adversarial imputation networks. Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity because of their effectiveness in the generative modeling task in images, texts, audio, etc. To our knowledge, less attention has been paid to the investigation of the effectiveness of diffusion models for missing value imputation in tabular data. Based on recent development of diffusion models for time-series data imputation, we propose a diffusion model approach called ``Conditional Score-based Diffusion Models for Tabular data'' (CSDI\_T). To effectively handle categorical variables and numerical variables simultaneously, we investigate three techniques: one-hot encoding, analog bits encoding, and feature tokenization. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of CSDI\_T compared with well-known existing methods, and also emphasized the importance of the categorical embedding techniques.},
