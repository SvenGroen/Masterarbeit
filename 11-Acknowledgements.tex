I would like to thank Dr. Fabian Panse for his time, support, and insights that helped me write this thesis.
My gratitude also goes to the authors of the Paper "TabDDPM: Modelling Tabular Data with Diffusion Models" \cite{kotelnikov2022TabDDPMModellingTabular},
Babenko, Rubachev, Baranchuk and Kotelnikov, whose work functioned as the baseline for my master thesis.
I specifically want to express my thanks to Mr. Akim Kotelnikov, who took the time to answer me multiple questions about their paper and software code.
