\section{Problem Statement and Motivation} 
\label{ch:intro-problemStatement}



a lot of success in the image generation domain, but tabular data generation much more impactful?

In the era of deep learning and big data, the need for accurate and reliable data in high quantities is paramount.
For machine and deep learning models, training data is essential to perform any kind of desired inference.
Gathering and accumulating real world data is still expensive and restricted through regulations like GDPR.
GAN models dominate the area of tab data syn.

Recently, diffusion models, a relatively new type of generative models, outperformed gans in image synthesis.
TabDDPM showed that this could be extended to tabular data.
in image synthesis, improvements done to gans appleid to diffusion models lead to very good performance 
--> do the same for tabular data
--> Can improvements be transferred
--> what aspects of synthesis are diffusions good at, what bad at

- tabular data format main form of data (used in several industries)
- over past few years a variety of genereative models appeard.

- Gans still fail to produce nicht unterscheidbare daten (pMSE score aus TabSynDex)
- success of DNNs \cite{borisov2022DeepNeuralNetworks}


% For what do we need data? --> data is used everywhere
% Problems of real data (scarcity, privacy, etc.)
% What is synthetic data in 1 sentence
% What is special about tabular data
% use cases of synthetic data (privacy, scalability, availability, etc.)
% Why to use diffusion for synthetic data generation


% Motivation: Diffusion Probabilistic Models
% GAN's very successful for tabular data synthesis (plateau reached?)
% Diffusion beat GAN's in image synthesis (why not for tabular data?)
% first research shows that diffusion is better than GAN's for tabular data
% several improvements had been done to GAN's but not yet for Diffusion models
% Question arises: Can improvements from GAN's be transferred to Diffusion models?

\section{Goals and Research Questions}
\label{ch:intro-goals}

% Goals: extend the existing code base for special data preprocessing, statistical similarity (and maybe U-Net architecture)
% Goals: analysis on how to improve a Diffusion model for tabular data synthesis

% Research Questions:
% 1. does preprocessing the data into a specific format improve the results?
% 2. how good is diffusion for tabular data synthesis in terms of statistical similarity?
% 3. does a special tabular data synthesis metric improve the results when used for hyperparameter optimization?

% (Wenn Zeit Ã¼brig ist):
% 3. does using a U-Net architecture improve the results? (maybe)
% 4. Can the similarity score be incorporated into the loss function? (maybe)


\section{Proceeeding}
\label{ch:intro-proceeeding}

% Proceeeding:
% Literature research on Diffusion models and GAN's
% --> What has been done, what has worked, what has not worked, what can be used for diffusion models
% --> decide which improvements are most promising and will be implemented
% Use existing code base for Diffusion models
% --> implement improvements proposed for GAN's and apply to them Diffusion
% --> train different Diffusion versions
% --> Evaluate the results with additional meassures (statistical meassures)
% Compare the results with the current state of the art
% Analyze the results and draw conclusions (what works, what doesn't work, what can be improved)
