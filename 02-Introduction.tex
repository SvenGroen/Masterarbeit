\section{Problem Statement and Motivation} 
\label{ch:intro-problemStatement}

% For what do we need data?

% Problems of real data (scarcity, privacy, etc.)

% What is synthetic data in 1 sentence

% What is special about tabular data

% use cases of synthetic data (privacy, scalability, availability, etc.)

% Why to use diffusion for synthetic data generation

\section{Approach and Proceeding}
\label{ch:intro-approach}

% Approach: Diffusion Probabilistic Models
% GAN's very successful for tabular data synthesis (plateau reached?)
% Diffusion beat GAN's in image synthesis (why not for tabular data?)
% first research shows that diffusion is better than GAN's for tabular data
% several improvements had been done to GAN's but not yet for Diffusion models
% Question arises: Can improvements from GAN's be transferred to Diffusion models?

% Proceeeding:
% Use existing code base for Diffusion models
% Experiment with several improvements proposed for GAN's and apply to Diffusion
% Evaluate the results with additional meassures


\section{Contributions}
\label{ch:intro-contributions}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
\label{ch:intro-contributions-dataPreprocessing}

% Data preprocessing is a crucial step in data synthesis
% Use special preprocessing for tabular data

\subsection{Model Architecture}
\label{ch:intro-contributions-modelArchitecture}

% Current Diffusion models are based on simple MLP's
% U-Net architecture is used for image synthesis
% Use U-Net architecture for tabular data synthesis?

\subsection*{Extended Evaluation}

% Current work focuses on Machine learning efficiency
% Add additional evaluation metrics
% "Similarity Score" used from Master thesis paper that aggregates several metrics
